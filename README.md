# Deep Learning for CMG Impact 2020
I have collected here a number of articles and papers that I thought would be useful to someone that attended my session at CMG Impact 2020 and was interested to learning more about this topic.

This site also includes the latest version of my slides that have changed a bit since I last submitted them to the CMG HQ for inclusion in the electronic Conference Proceedings.

If you find any additional resources that you think would be a good addition to this list of resources please let me known by sending a pull requesst.
